# Realtime-Device-Tracking
This backend project focuses on real-time device tracking using Node.js and Express for the server-side logic, and Socket.io for real-time communication.
The project leverages Leaflet, a popular JavaScript library, to display interactive maps.
The aim is to provide a dynamic and responsive application that can track and visualize device locations in real-time on a map interface.
